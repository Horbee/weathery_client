## Weathery Client

Weathery is a demo application which fetches and represents the current weather information of a city based on the data from the [Openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

The front end is built with React and Typescript using `Functional Components, Hooks and the Context API`.

Application is available  [here](https://weatheryclient.netlify.app/)

### Get started

After you cloned the repository run `npm install` to install the required dependencies and `npm start` to start the application.

To utilize the OAuth login functionality with Facebook and Google, you have to provide the `Google Client Id` and the `Facebook App Id`. For this, you have to register and app under the Google developer console and Facebook for Developers console. After that, you have to edit the `.env` file in the root of the project.

The `REACT_APP_API_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:5000` you can customise this in the `.env` file.
